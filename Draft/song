You said that you love me
But you told a lie
Outside you're lovely
But I've seen inside
And all of your friends told me
Time wasn't right

You go too slow
You stay so cold
I speak my mind
You still say no

It's blurry nights that haunt my mind
Don't wanna find out, might just cry
I might have tied myself up high
And just let go, I'll touch the sky for you
It's blurry nights I can't get through
You told me lies I thought were true
But, I'll get over you

Two things on my birthday
I don't want a cake, give me a Sunday
Where I don't think of getting hanged
I don't wanna play just give me one day
Where I don't think of getting played
I'm a sensitive guy with no touch√©
I done fucked up, on my plate
I got plenty of problems, and it's too late

It's blurry nights that haunt my mind
Don't wanna find out, might just cry
I might have tied myself up high
And just let go, I'll touch the sky for you
It's blurry nights I can't get through
You told me lies I thought were true
But, I'll get over you

You go too slow
You stay so cold
I speak my mind
You still say no

It's blurry nights that haunt my mind
Don't wanna find out, might just cry
I might have tied myself up high
And just let go, I'll touch the sky for you
It's blurry nights I can't get through
You told me lies I thought were true
But, I'll get over you
